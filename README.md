# Microservice
A microservice is an application architecture that separates each application function into its own service from the others. These services can be deployed independently and are loosely connected that communicate through lightweight protocols.<br>
This microservice performs three tasks :- 
* Error handling - to handle server status
* Visitor counter - to count the number of visitors
* Authentication<br><br>
